Configuring a block
===================
Go into block administration (admin/build/block)

Choose the block you want to configure (Ticker 1, 2 or 3) and drag it into the section where you want it displayed (or use the dropdown to place it in a content region).  Then click "Save blocks".

Then click "configure" alongside the block.  The block configuration screen has the standard Drupal configuration options (Title, Visibility, Roles, Pages).  In addition, you can set:
 - Block title - ie to be displayed as a heading, enter <none> if no heading wanted
 - Text - text to be displayed before the ticker
 - The Nodes to be displayed in the ticker - this should be a comma-separated list of node numbers, eg 101, 102, 103 ... etc
 - Transition time - the number of seconds it takes for the ticker to move from one item to the next
 - Pause time - the number of seconds the ticker should pasue on each item
 - Direction - horizontal or vertical
 - Ticker style - CSS attributes to wrap around the ticker content - if you want any padding, put it in here
 - Item width - the width, in pixels, of each item displayed
 - Item height - the height, in pixels, of each item displayed
 - Item spacing - distance, in pixels, between each item
 - Ticker item style - CSS attributes to put on individual items - Note: margin and padding tend to confuse the ticker so avoid using these
 - Offset - move the "home" position of each item by this number of pixels
